    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><b>This potato soup recipe is the ultimate comfort food for a cold day!</b> It’s 
        like a loaded baked potato in soup form—the thick, creamy, savory soup is piled 
        high with toppings like sour cream, shredded cheese, and green onions or chives.
    </p>
    <p><b>Luckily, this potato soup comes together in one pot with simple ingredients,
    </b> so it’ll be easy to keep in our rotation this winter.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 celery rib, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 cups vegetable broth</li>
        <li>2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes or yellow potatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium carrot, chopped</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, grated</li>
        <li>3 fresh thyme sprigs, bundled</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sea salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, <em>optional</em></li>
        <li>Chopped fresh chives or green onions</li>
        <li>Grated cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>Sour cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onion and 
            celery and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 to 8 minutes, or until softened. 
            Add the flour and cook, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the flour is 
            lightly golden. While stirring, slowly pour in the broth.</li>
        <li>Add the potatoes, carrots, garlic, thyme, salt, smoked paprika, and several 
            grinds of pepper. Simmer for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the thyme bundle and use an immersion blender to blend the soup until it 
            is mostly smooth but still has some larger potato chunks. If the soup is too 
            thick to blend, add water, ¼ cup at a time, as needed to reach your desired 
            consistency. Alternatively, allow the soup to cool slightly and transfer half to 
            an upright blender. Blend until smooth, then return to the pot with the remaining 
            chunky soup and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Add the cream and gently simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the 
            lemon juice, if using.</li>
        <li>Season to taste and serve with desired toppings.</li>
    </ol>
