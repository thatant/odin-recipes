    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><b>Our kiddo loves this homemade ranch dressing…and honestly, I do too!</b> It
         has a delicious creamy texture and tangy, savory flavor. Keep it on the thicker 
         side to use as a dip with veggies, or thin it out to drizzle over salads and 
         pizzas (if ranch on pizza happens to be your thing).</p>
    <p><b>This ranch dressing recipe calls for simple ingredients,</b> which make it
         taste SO much better than any store-bought ranch dressing I’ve tried. It has a 
         rich sour cream base (Greek yogurt works too!), and seasonings like dried dill 
         and garlic powder add bold flavor. Fresh lemon juice gives it a perfect bright 
         finish.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup sour cream or whole milk Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>¼ to ½ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 to 4 tablespoons buttermilk or any milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried dill</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>¼ to ½ teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives, <em>optional</em></li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill, <em>optional</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the sour cream, ¼ cup mayonnaise, 2 
            tablespoons milk, dried dill, lemon juice, vinegar, garlic powder, onion 
            powder, ¼ teaspoon salt, and several grinds of pepper. For a thicker dressing,
             add more mayonnaise. For a thinner dressing, add more milk.</li>
        <li>Season to taste, adding more salt if desired. Fold in the chives and dill, if 
            using.</li>
        <li>Use as a salad dressing or dip, or try one of the serving suggestions in the 
            blog post above. Store dressing in an airtight container in the refrigerator 
            for up to 5 days.</li>
    </ol>
